# TriviaGame

Made with a spongebob theme (honestly, not a big spongebob fan myself, just wanted some nautical theme).

You have 60 seconds to answer all the questions to the best of your knowledge. Some of the answers are very clearly troll answers, I can guarantee that all of the answers are the logically correct answer.

Reset button not included (a few attempts crashed my javascript), so refresh the page to try again. Will try to implement this correctly in the near future.
